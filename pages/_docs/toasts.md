### Default markup

{% example %}
{% include ui/toast.html %}
{% endexample %}

### Translucent

Toasts are slightly translucent, too, so they blend over whatever they might appear over. For browsers that support the `backdrop-filter` CSS property, weâ€™ll also attempt to blur the elements under a toast.

{% example html class=bg-gray %}
{% include ui/toast.html %}
{% endexample %}

### Stacking toasts

If you want to stack toasts just put them in the same container.

{% example %}
{% include ui/toast.html person-id=3 %}
{% include ui/toast.html date="7 mins ago" text="This is another toast message." %}
{% endexample %}
